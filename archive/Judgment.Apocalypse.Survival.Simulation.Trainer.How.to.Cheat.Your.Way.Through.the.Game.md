Here are some tips on how to play Judgment: Apocalypse Survival Simulation with or without using a trainer:

1. **Plan your base layout**: You need to build various structures to provide shelter, food, water, power, defense, and research for your survivors. You also need to consider the terrain, the resources, and the enemy attacks. Try to place your buildings close together to save space and reduce travel time. Also, use walls and traps to protect your base from invaders.
2. **Manage your survivors**: You can recruit new survivors by rescuing them from the map or by completing missions. Each survivor has a name, a portrait, a personality, a background, and a set of skills and traits. You can assign them to different tasks, such as gathering, crafting, farming, researching, or fighting. You can also equip them with weapons, armor, and accessories. You need to keep an eye on their health, energy, nutrition, and morale. If they get injured, sick, hungry, or depressed, they will perform worse or even die.
3. **Research new technologies**: You can unlock new buildings, items, skills, and abilities by researching various topics in the occult lab. You need to collect research materials from the map or from enemies. You can also find ancient scrolls that grant you instant research. Researching can help you improve your base efficiency, your combat effectiveness, and your survival chances.
4. **Explore the world**: You can send your survivors to explore the map and scavenge for resources, items, survivors, or missions. You can also encounter random events that can be beneficial or harmful. You need to be careful though, as the world is full of dangers and enemies. You can encounter demons of different types and strengths. Some of them can fly, shoot fireballs, summon minions, or cast spells. You need to use the right weapons and tactics to defeat them.
5. **Prepare for the final battle**: The game has a main storyline that involves finding out the origin of the apocalypse and stopping it. You will have to face a powerful boss at the end of the game. To do that, you need to complete a series of missions that will lead you to the final showdown. You need to make sure your base is well defended and your survivors are well equipped and trained before you take on the ultimate challenge.

Judgment: Apocalypse Survival Simulation is a game that offers a lot of replay value and customization options. You can choose from different difficulty levels, game modes, scenarios, and settings. You can also mod the game or create your own content with the built-in editor. Whether you use a trainer or not, you can have a lot of fun with this game.
